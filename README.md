The first job to be done is to set up the wireless connection. Students may help with this task so that setting up a wireless connection can be completed in other environments more independently. Students may want to use a wireless connection at home or in a public library.
##### Tasks:

Below is a sample of how to connect the BrailleNote to wireless Internet that is an open connection with no password required. Setting up a wireless or LAN connection varies depending on the settings that are in place. For school connections, the IT staff may be able to help. It is often helpful to have HumanWare tech support on the phone while working with IT staff. Arrange times with all concerned ahead of time if possible.
